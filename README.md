This is an data-stack-in-a-box based data from [NSW Education Data](https://data.nsw.gov.au/). With the push of one button you can have your own data stack up and running in 5 mins! 🏎️


## 🚀 TL;DR - What have we achieved?

### Data Stack

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Click below 👇🏼 to setup your own free data stack packed with [NSW Department of Education](https://education.nsw.gov.au/) data.

### Reports
This dashboard contains all the metrics we have collected in this data stack project. It uses a visualisation as code tool called [evidence.dev](https:evidence.dev).

## 💡 Objectives

### Main quests
[NSW Department of Education](https://education.nsw.gov.au/) data stack in a box has two objectives:
1)	Getting humans excited about the publicly available data curated by NSW Department of Education and our partners.
2)	Simple one click totally free 💲 data stack, aiding in learning and proof of concepts.


### Side quests
- Help identify data quality and reliability issues with our data. This project is being run daily with several tests so hopefully we can find any issues first!
- Building a report that shows all metrics related to [(NSW) Department of Education (DOE)](https://education.nsw.gov.au/) data, and consolidate any other publicaly available data.


## 🤗 Audience
The project is designed to be very simple when getting started but allows you to go as deep you like!
- **I want to analyse and gain insights into the data.** With the infrastructure free and deployed in one click you don’t need to worry about any implementation details. You can skip straight to analysing and training ML models on top of your own local warehouse.
- **Interested in modelling via SQL?** We got you covered with a environment setup for DBT.
- **Love DevOps and platform engineering?** Check out our Orchestration, CICD pipelines, and automation such as linting, ect.


## 🥨 Overview of Data Stack (Architecture)


![Data Architecture](.github/static/architecture.png)


> [!NOTE] We are simply going to extract data from the [Data.NSW](https://data.nsw.gov.au/) and load it into our in memory data warehouse 🦆, model, clean, and analyse our data.
> [Data.NSW](https://data.nsw.gov.au/) behind the scenes uses [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) an open source data management system used by the likes of [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en.html), [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/), and [USAs Open Data](https://data.gov/).


> [!WARNING]
> Some of the datasets from ACARA and [Data.NSW](https://data.nsw.gov.au/) are based on CSV files located on their sites. This is challenging as the CSV name and URL for future datasets is unknown, so requires a code change each time new data arrives.


<!-- ## Option tooling (Architecture) 🥨

> [!NOTE] These components are purley for demoing purposes. They are not needed in the project.

- Tableau
  - ai monitoring
- Power BI
- Open Metadata
- DBT Cloud
  - semantic layer
  - column level linage

This is a high level overview of the entities that we are going to model in this project.

> [!NOTE] Limitation -
The data available publically for each entitity does not go down to a student. In some cases school level data is avaiable. But most entities only have data published at a state wide (NSW) aggregate level.

### ERD

🚧 TODO [Dimensional ERD check out](./ERD.md)

### Give me more data!

#### Data that I want from DOE

- `Number of techers per school` was on the data hub but was removed citing will now be reported by ABS. But ABS data isnt at a school level.

#### Data from ACARA / NESA

- `NAPLAN` and `HSC attainment` by school. Can get NAPLAN by school going to ACARA's [MySchool](https://www.myschool.edu.au/school/41307) but no easy way to get a view for all schools data.



## Contributing

See below. Also checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/wisemuffin/nsw-doe-data-stack-in-a-box/wiki) with this repo for more info on the project.


To submit your code, fork the repository, create a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop) on your fork, and open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) once your work is ready for review.

In the PR template, please describe the change, including the motivation/context, test coverage, and any other relevant information. Please note if the PR is a breaking change or if it is related to an open GitHub issue.

A Core reviewer will review your PR in around five business days and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved. Once approved and all the tests pass, the reviewer will click the Squash and merge button in Github 🥳.

<!-- Your PR is now merged into Dagster! We’ll shout out your contribution in the release notes. -->


### Contributing - Data Analyses & Reporting



to run the report locally simply run:

```bash
task evidence_setup && evidence
task evidence
```

> [!WARNING] make sure that your dagster pipeline isnt running, when running evidence. Also close down the reporting server `ctrl+c` before you start dagster up again via `task dag`. This is due to a limitation with duckdb locking.

### Contributing - Data Science

🚧 TODO - currently data scientists need to know how to work with pipelines. Still experimenting with this. But you can have a go with the examples that already exist in dagster.

### Contributing - Data Modeling

I have been following the gitlab's data team's handbook for modeling, naming convetions and testing.

I am pretty relaxed with standards in this project. But please read through these before developing to help standise the modeling:

- [Enterprise data warehouse](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/edw/)
- Tests
- SQL style guide


Differences to gitlab's data team's handbook:

1) Raw and other schema's 🚧 TODO - simplify CICD have just used one schema, prefix should be enough
2) staging layer added between raw and prep layers.

<!-- - update ERDs. [dbterd](https://dbterd.datnguyen.de) which turns your [dbt relationship data quality checks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests#generic-data-tests) into an ERD.

```bash
dbt docs generate
.venv/bin/python ERD_generation.py
```
-->

make sure you lint your code with `sqlfluff`:
```bash
sqlfluff lint
sqlfluff fix
```


### Contributing - Pipeline Code / Ingestion

Dagster should automatically start in your codespace (give it a couple of mins for the setup to complete). If you have exited dagster simply type `task dag` on the command line to get it running again.

**testing**

We use `pytest`

**debugging dagster**

To debug dagster you should run `dagster dev` in debug mode. This allows you to set breakpoints in vs code. Simply hit `F5` in vscode (just check that your debug config is set to `Dagster: Debug Dagit UI`).

Behind the scenes VSCode is using `launch.json` with the following args to run dagster in debug mode. Then just select the assets in dagster UI to materialise. If you set breakpoints they will be

```json
{
    "name": "dagster dev",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "dagster",
    "args": [
        "dev",
    ],
    "subProcess": true
}
```

This is one of the first things i wish i knew when learning dagster!

Due to the evolving nature of school information and local enrolment areas, no responsibility can be taken by the NSW Department of Education, or any of its associated departments, if information is relied upon. For example, but not limited to, real estate purchases or rentals where the school intake zone data is used as a reference source.
